    ".If no suitable keyword applies, label it as 'ETC'. In other words, each preferential condition must map to exactly one keyword.\n\n"

    "## KOREAN TEXT STANDARDIZATION\n"
    "- Replace any English terms with Korean equivalents:\n"
    "  * 'Internet Banking' → '인터넷뱅킹'\n"
    "  * 'Mobile Banking' → '모바일뱅킹'\n"
    "  * 'Branch Visit' → '영업점 방문'\n"
    "  * 'Online' → '온라인'\n"
    "  * 'Offline' → '오프라인'\n"
    "  * 'ATM' → 'ATM' (acceptable as commonly used Korean term)\n"
    "  * Any other English terms should be converted to Korean or marked as '해당사항 없음' if unclear.\n\n"

    "## AMOUNT NORMALIZATION RULES (APPLY BEFORE OUTPUT)\n"
    "- The following inputs MUST be normalized to -1 (meaning 'no limit' or 'not specified'):\n"
    "  * null/None, empty string, 'N/A', '-', '무제한', '제한 없음', '없음', '해당사항 없음'.\n"
    "  * Any negative sentinel such as -99, -999, -9999, -99999, -999999, etc.\n"
    "  * Extremely large placeholders indicating 'unlimited', e.g., >= 9,000,000,000,000,000,000\n"
    "    (including 9223372036854775807).\n"
    "- Otherwise, keep the numeric value as-is.\n"
    "- IMPORTANT: 0 is a valid numeric value and MUST NOT be converted to -1.\n"
    "- For minimum fields: if normalized to -1, treat as 'no minimum'. For maximum fields: if normalized to -1, treat as 'no limit'.\n"
    "- If min > max and max != -1, set max = -1 (assume the upper limit is effectively unlimited due to inconsistency).\n\n"

    "## PERIOD FIELDS\n"
    "\"product_period_period\" and \"product_period_basic_rate\" MUST follow these rules:\n"
    "1) SHAPE (choose exactly one mode)\n"
    "   - Mode A (bucketed):\n"
    "     * \"product_period_period\": an array of bracketed range strings.\n"
    "       Each item is exactly: \"[min_months, max_months]\" where min_months/max_months are JSON numbers,\n"
    "       and max_months may be '-' for open-ended.\n"
    "       Examples: \"[1, 5]\", \"[6, 11]\", \"[12, 23]\", \"[24, 35]\", \"[36, 60]\", \"[60, -]\"\n"
    "     * \"product_period_basic_rate\": number array, SAME LENGTH as \"product_period_period\".\n"
    "   - Mode B (single range):\n"
    "     * \"product_period_period\": a SINGLE bracketed range string, e.g. \"[12, 12]\", \"[12, -]\", \"[1, 36]\"\n"
    "     * \"product_period_basic_rate\": a SINGLE number (length = 1)\n\n"

    "2) ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:\n"
    "   - Do NOT output natural language in periods. NEVER write things like \"1년이상\", \"3년제\", \"12개월\".\n"
    "   - Do NOT output plain numbers or quoted numbers in periods like \"12\", \"36\".\n"
    "   - NEVER output without square brackets. For example, \"12, 12\" is INVALID — it must be \"[12, 12]\".\n"
    "   - Period items must be bracketed range strings ONLY (e.g., \"[12, 12]\"), not JSON arrays like [12,12], and not bare strings like \"12\".\n"
    "   - Percent signs are forbidden in rates. Use numbers only (e.g., 3.65 not \"3.65%\").\n\n"

    "3) NORMALIZATION RULES (for periods):\n"
    "   Convert any natural-language period to bracketed months:\n"
    "   - \"N개월\" (exact)               → \"[N, N]\"\n"
    "   - \"N개월 이상\"                  → \"[N, -]\"\n"
    "   - \"N개월 이하\" / \"최대 N개월\"   → \"[0, N]\"\n"
    "   - \"N~M개월\" / \"N개월 이상 M개월 이하\" → \"[N, M]\"\n"
    "   - \"N년\" (exact)                 → \"[12*N, 12*N]\"\n"
    "   - \"N년 이상\"                    → \"[12*N, -]\"\n"
    "   - \"N년 이하\"                    → \"[0, 12*N]\"\n"
    "   - \"N~M년\"                       → \"[12*N, 12*M]\"\n"
    "   - \"N년제\"                       → \"[12*N, 12*N]\"\n"
    "   - \"1년\" is \"[12, 12]\"; \"3년이상\" is \"[36, -]\"\n\n"
    "   - If the source uses DAYS:\n"
    "       * \"N일\" (exact)                  → \"[ceil(N/30), ceil(N/30)]\"\n"
    "       * \"N일 이상\"                      → \"[ceil(N/30), -]\"\n"
    "       * \"N일 이하\" / \"최대 N일\"         → \"[0, ceil(N/30)]\"\n"
    "       * \"N~M일\" / \"N일 이상 M일 이하\"    → \"[ceil(N/30), ceil(M/30)]\"\n\n"

    "4) SELF-CORRECTION RULES:\n"
    "   - If you produced two plain numbers like [\"12\",\"36\"] with ONE rate, MERGE them into a single range string: \"[12, 36]\" (Mode B).\n"
    "   - If you produced a list of natural-language labels, REPLACE ALL with properly bracketed range strings per the normalization rules.\n"
    "   - If you produced a value like \"12, 12\" (missing brackets), FIX it to \"[12, 12]\" before final output.\n"
    "   - If lengths mismatch between periods and rates in Mode A, either:\n"
    "       a) split/merge ranges so counts match, or\n"
    "       b) fallback to Mode B with a single merged range and a single rate.\n"
    "   - Never output invalid shapes. If information is insufficient to build multiple buckets, use Mode B.\n\n"

    "5) FORMAT GUARANTEE:\n"
    "   - Every item in \"product_period_period\" MUST match this regex exactly:\n"
    "     ^\\[\\s*(\\d+|-)\\s*,\\s*(\\d+|-)\\s*\\]$\n"
    "   - If any item fails this regex, FIX IT before output.\n\n"

    "6) EXAMPLES:\n"
    "   - Ideal bucketed (Mode A):\n"
    "     \"product_period_period\": [\"[1, 5]\",\"[6, 11]\",\"[12, 23]\",\"[24, 35]\",\"[36, 60]\"],\n"
    "     \"product_period_basic_rate\": [1.5,1.85,2.0,1.7,1.7]\n"
    "   - From natural language (normalize):\n"
    "     Input like [\"1년이상\",\"3년제\"] → \"product_period_period\": [\"[12, -]\",\"[36, 36]\"]\n"
    "   - Two numbers + one rate:\n"
    "     Input like [\"12\",\"36\"] with [1.9] → \"product_period_period\": \"[12, 36]\", \"product_period_basic_rate\": [1.9]\n\n"

    "## FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST\n"
    "Before outputting JSON, verify:\n"
    "- [ ] All text fields use Korean language only\n"
    "- [ ] Missing information is marked as '해당사항 없음' (not English equivalents)\n"
    "- [ ] No English terms like 'N/A', 'Not Available', 'None', etc.\n"
    "- [ ] All numerical amounts follow the normalization rules\n"
    "- [ ] Period formats match the required bracketed format\n"
    "- [ ] Arrays have matching lengths where required\n\n"
